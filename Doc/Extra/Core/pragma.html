<h1 align="center">PRAGMA Statements</h1>



<p>The PRAGMA statement is an SQL extension specific to SQLite and used to 
modify the operation of the SQLite library or to query the SQLite library for 
internal (non-table) data. The PRAGMA statement is issued using the same
interface as other SQLite commands (e.g. <a href="lang_select.html">SELECT</a>, <a href="lang_insert.html">INSERT</a>) but is
different in the following important respects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific pragma statements may be removed and others added in future
    releases of SQLite. There is no guarantee of backwards compatibility.
<li>No error messages are generated if an unknown pragma is issued.
    Unknown pragmas are simply ignored. This means if there is a typo in 
    a pragma statement the library does not inform the user of the fact.
<li>Some pragmas take effect during the SQL compilation stage, not the
    execution stage. This means if using the C-language <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a>, 
    <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a>, <a href="c3ref/finalize.html">sqlite3_finalize()</a> API (or similar in a wrapper 
    interface), the pragma may run during the <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> call,
    not during the <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a> call as normal SQL statements do.
    Or the pragma might run during sqlite3_step() just like normal
    SQL statements.  Whether or not the pragma runs during sqlite3_prepare()
    or sqlite3_step() depends on the pragma and on the specific release
    of SQLite.
<li>The pragma command is specific to SQLite and is very unlikely 
    to be compatible with any other SQL database engine.
</ul>

<p>The C-language API for SQLite provides the <a href="c3ref/c_fcntl_busyhandler.html#sqlitefcntlpragma">SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA</a>
<a href="c3ref/file_control.html">file control</a> which gives <a href="vfs.html">VFS</a> implementations the
opportunity to add new PRAGMA statements or to override the meaning of
built-in PRAGMA statements.</p>

<p>
A pragma can take either zero or one argument.  The argument is may be either
in parentheses or it may be separated from the pragma name by an equal sign.
The two syntaxes yield identical results.
In many pragmas, the argument is a boolean.  The boolean can be one of:
</p>

<center>
<b>1 yes true on<br>0 no false off</b>
</center>

<p>Keyword arguments can optionally appear in quotes.  
(Example:  <tt>'yes' &#91;FALSE&#93;</tt>.) Some pragmas
takes a string literal as their argument.  When pragma takes a keyword
argument, it will usually also take a numeric equivalent as well.
For example, "0" and "no" mean the same thing, as does "1" and "yes".
When querying the value of a setting, many pragmas return the number
rather than the keyword.</p>

<p>A pragma may have an optional database name before the pragma name.
The database name is the name of an <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a>-ed database or it can be
"main" or "temp" for the main and the TEMP databases.  If the optional
database name is omitted, "main" is assumed.  In some pragmas, the database
name is meaningless and is simply ignored.</p>

<a name="pragma_application_id"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA application_id;
       <br>PRAGMA application_id = </b><i>integer </i><b>;</b>
  
<p>    The application_id PRAGMA is used to query or set the 32-bit
       unsigned big-endian "Application ID" integer located at offset
       68 into the <a href="fileformat2.html#database_header">database header</a>.  Applications that use SQLite as their
       <a href="appfileformat.html">application file-format</a> should set the Application ID integer to
       a unique integer so that utilities such as 
       <a href="http://www.darwinsys.com/file/">file(1)</a> can determine the specific
       file type rather than just reporting "SQLite3 Database".  A list of
       assigned application IDs can be seen by consulting the
       <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=magic.txt">magic.txt</a> file in the SQLite source repository.
<a name="pragma_auto_vacuum"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA auto_vacuum;<br>
          PRAGMA auto_vacuum = </b>
           <i>0 | NONE | 1 | FULL | 2 | INCREMENTAL</i><b>;</b></p>

    <p>Query or set the auto-vacuum status in the database.</p>

    <p>The default setting for auto-vacuum is 0 or "none",
    unless the <a href="compile.html#default_autovacuum">SQLITE_DEFAULT_AUTOVACUUM</a> compile-time option is used.
    The "none" setting means that auto-vacuum is disabled.
    When auto-vacuum is disabled and data is deleted data from a database,
    the database file remains the same size.  Unused database file 
    pages are added to a "<a href="fileformat2.html#freelist">freelist</a>" and reused for subsequent inserts.  So
    no database file space is lost.  However, the database file does not
    shrink.  In this mode the <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>
    command can be used to rebuild the entire database file and
    thus reclaim unused disk space.</p>

    <p>When the auto-vacuum mode is 1  or "full", the freelist pages are
    moved to the end of the database file and the database file is truncated
    to remove the freelist pages at every transaction commit.
    Note, however, that auto-vacuum only truncates the freelist pages
    from the file.  Auto-vacuum does not defragment the database nor
    repack individual database pages the way that the
    <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command does.  In fact, because
    it moves pages around within the file, auto-vacuum can actually
    make fragmentation worse.</p>

    <p>Auto-vacuuming is only possible if the database stores some
    additional information that allows each database page to be
    traced backwards to its referrer.  Therefore, auto-vacuuming must
    be turned on before any tables are created.  It is not possible
    to enable or disable auto-vacuum after a table has been created.</p>

    <p>When the value of auto-vacuum is 2 or "incremental" then the additional
    information needed to do auto-vacuuming is stored in the database file
    but auto-vacuuming does not occur automatically at each commit as it
    does with auto_vacuum=full.  In incremental mode, the separate
    <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> pragma must
    be invoked to cause the auto-vacuum to occur.</p>

    <p>The database connection can be changed between full and incremental
    autovacuum mode at any time.  However, changing from
    "none" to "full" or "incremental" can only occur when the database 
    is new (no tables
    have yet been created) or by running the <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command.  To
    change auto-vacuum modes, first use the auto_vacuum pragma to set
    the new desired mode, then invoke the <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command to 
    reorganize the entire database file.  To change from "full" or
    "incremental" back to "none" always requires running <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> even
    on an empty database.
    </p>

    <p>When the auto_vacuum pragma is invoked with no arguments, it
    returns the current auto_vacuum mode.</p>
<a name="pragma_automatic_index"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA automatic_index;
     <br>PRAGMA automatic_index = </b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>

    <p>Query, set, or clear the <a href="optoverview.html#autoindex">automatic indexing</a> capability.
    <p><a href="optoverview.html#autoindex">Automatic indexing</a> is enabled by default as of version 3.7.17,
    but this might change in future releases of SQLite.
<a name="pragma_busy_timeout"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA busy_timeout;
         <br>PRAGMA busy_timeout = </b><i>milliseconds</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>Query or change the setting of the
    <a href="c3ref/busy_timeout.html">busy timeout</a>.
    This pragma is an alternative to the <a href="c3ref/busy_timeout.html">sqlite3_busy_timeout()</a> C-language
    interface which is made available as a pragma for use with language
    bindings that do not provide direct access to <a href="c3ref/busy_timeout.html">sqlite3_busy_timeout()</a>.

    <p>Each database connection can only have a single
    <a href="c3ref/busy_handler.html">busy handler</a>.  This PRAGMA sets the busy handler
    for the process, possibly overwriting any previously set busy handler.
<a name="pragma_cache_size"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA cache_size;
       <br>PRAGMA cache_size = </b><i>pages</i><b>;
       <br>PRAGMA cache_size = -</b><i>kibibytes</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>Query or change the suggested maximum number of database disk pages
    that SQLite will hold in memory at once per open database file.  Whether
    or not this suggestion is honored is at the discretion of the
    <a href="c3ref/pcache_methods2.html">Application Defined Page Cache</a>.
    The default page cache that is built into SQLite honors the request,
    however alternative application-defined page cache implementations
    may choose to interpret the suggested cache size in different ways
    or to ignore it all together.
    The default suggested cache size is 2000 pages.</p>

    <p>If the argument N is positive then the suggested cache size is set 
    to N. If the argument N is negative, then the
    number of cache pages is adjusted to use approximately N*1024 bytes
    of memory.
    <i>Backwards compatibility note:</i>
    The behavior of cache_size with a negative N
    was different in SQLite versions prior to 3.7.10.  In
    version 3.7.9 and earlier, the number of pages in the cache was set
    to the absolute value of N.</p>

    <p>When you change the cache size using the cache_size pragma, the
    change only endures for the current session.  The cache size reverts
    to the default value when the database is closed and reopened.</p>


<a name="pragma_cache_spill"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA cache_spill;
         <br>PRAGMA cache_spill=</b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>

    <p>The cache_spill pragma enables or disables the ability of the pager
    to spill dirty cache pages to the database file in the middle of a 
    transaction.  Cache_spill is enabled by default and most applications
    should leave it that way as cache spilling is usually advantageous.
    However, a cache spill has the side-effect of acquiring an
    <a href="lockingv3.html#excl_lock">EXCLUSIVE lock</a> on the database file.  Hence, some applications that
    have large long-running transactions may want to disable cache spilling
    in order to prevent the application from acquiring an exclusive lock
    on the database until the moment that the transaction <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a>s.
<a name="pragma_case_sensitive_like"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA case_sensitive_like = </b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>The default behavior of the <a href="lang_expr.html#like">LIKE</a> operator is to ignore case
    for ASCII characters. Hence, by default <b>'a' LIKE 'A'</b> is
    true.  The case_sensitive_like pragma installs a new application-defined
    LIKE function that is either case sensitive or insensitive depending
    on the value of the case_sensitive_like pragma.
    When case_sensitive_like is disabled, the default LIKE behavior is
    expressed.  When case_sensitive_like is enabled, case becomes
    significant.  So, for example,
    <b>'a' LIKE 'A'</b> is false but <b>'a' LIKE 'a'</b> is still true.</p>

    <p>This pragma uses <a href="c3ref/create_function.html">sqlite3_create_function()</a> to overload the
    LIKE and GLOB functions, which may override previous implementations
    of LIKE and GLOB registered by the application.</p>
<a name="pragma_checkpoint_fullfsync"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA checkpoint_fullfsync
       <br>PRAGMA checkpoint_fullfsync = </b><i>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>
    <p>Query or change the fullfsync flag for <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> operations.
    If this flag is set, then the F_FULLFSYNC syncing method is used
    during checkpoint operations on systems that support F_FULLFSYNC. 
    The default value of the checkpoint_fullfsync flag
    is off.  Only Mac OS-X supports F_FULLFSYNC.</p>

    <p>If the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_fullfsync">fullfsync</a> flag is set, then the F_FULLFSYNC syncing
    method is used for all sync operations and the checkpoint_fullfsync
    setting is irrelevant.</p>
<a name="pragma_collation_list"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA collation_list;</b></p>
    <p>Return a list of the collating sequences defined for the current
    database connection.</p>
<a name="pragma_compile_options"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA compile_options;</b></p>
    <p>This pragma returns the names of <a href="compile.html">compile-time options</a> used when
    building SQLite, one option per row.  The "SQLITE_" prefix is omitted
    from the returned option names.  See also the
    <a href="c3ref/compileoption_get.html">sqlite3_compileoption_get()</a> C/C++ interface and the
    <a href="lang_corefunc.html#sqlite_compileoption_get">sqlite_compileoption_get()</a> SQL functions.</p>
<a name="pragma_count_changes"></a>
<hr>
    <p><b>PRAGMA count_changes;
       <br>PRAGMA count_changes = </b>boolean</i><b>;</b></p>

    <p>Query or change the count-changes flag. Normally, when the
    count-changes flag is not set, <a href="lang_insert.html">INSERT</a>, <a href="lang_update.html">UPDATE</a> and <a href="lang_delete.html">DELETE</a> statements
    return no data. When count-changes is set, each of these commands 
    returns a single row of data consisting of one integer value - the
    number of rows inserted, modified or deleted by the command. The 
    returned change count does not include any insertions, modifications
    or deletions performed by triggers, or any changes made automatically

    <p>Another way to get the row change counts is to use the
    <a href="c3ref/changes.html">sqlite3_changes()</a> or <a href="c3ref/total_changes.html">sqlite3_total_changes()</a> interfaces.
    There is a subtle different, though.  When an INSERT, UPDATE, or
    DELETE is run against a view using an <a href="lang_createtrigger.html#instead_of_trigger">INSTEAD OF trigger</a>,
    the count_changes pragma reports the number of rows in the view
    that fired the trigger, whereas <a href="c3ref/changes.html">sqlite3_changes()</a> and
    <a href="c3ref/total_changes.html">sqlite3_total_changes()</a> do not.

    <p>This pragma queries or sets the journal mode for databases
    associated with the current <a href="c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>.</p>

    <p>The first two forms of this pragma query the current journaling
    mode for <i>database</i>.  When <i>database</i> is omitted, the
    "main" database is queried.</p>

    <p>The last two forms change the journaling mode.  The 4th form
    changes the journaling mode for a specific database connection named.
    Use "main" for the main database (the database that was opened by
    the original <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open()</a>, <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open16()</a>, or
    <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a> interface call) and use "temp" for database
    that holds TEMP tables.  The 3rd form changes the journaling mode
    on all databases attached to the connection.
    The new journal mode is returned.  If the journal mode
    could not be changed, the original journal mode is returned.</p>

    <p>The DELETE journaling mode is the normal behavior.  In the DELETE
    mode, the rollback journal is deleted at the conclusion of each
    transaction.  Indeed, the delete operation is the action that causes
    the transaction to commit.
    (See the document titled <a href="atomiccommit.html">
    Atomic Commit In SQLite</a> for additional detail.)</p>

    <p>The TRUNCATE journaling mode commits transactions by truncating
    the rollback journal to zero-length instead of deleting it.  On many
    systems, truncating a file is much faster than deleting the file since
    the containing directory does not need to be changed.</p>

    <p>The PERSIST journaling mode prevents the rollback journal from
    being deleted at the end of each transaction.  Instead, the header
    of the journal is overwritten with zeros.  This will prevent other
    database connections from rolling the journal back.  The PERSIST
    journaling mode is useful as an optimization on platforms where
    deleting or truncating a file is much more expensive than overwriting
    the first block of a file with zeros.  See also:
    <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_size_limit">PRAGMA journal_size_limit</a> and <a href="compile.html#default_journal_size_limit">SQLITE_DEFAULT_JOURNAL_SIZE_LIMIT</a>.</p>

    <p>The MEMORY journaling mode stores the rollback journal in 
    volatile RAM.  This saves disk I/O but at the expense of database
    safety and integrity.  If the application using SQLite crashes in
    the middle of a transaction when the MEMORY journaling mode is set,
    then the database file will very likely go corrupt.</p>

    <p>The WAL journaling mode uses a <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> instead of a
    rollback journal to implement transactions.  The WAL journaling mode
    is persistent; after being set it stays in effect
    across multiple database connections and after closing and
    reopening the database.  A database in WAL journaling mode
    can only be accessed by SQLite version 3.7.0 or later.</p>

    <p>The OFF journaling mode disables the rollback journal completely.
    No rollback journal is ever created and hence there is never a rollback
    journal to delete.  The OFF journaling mode disables the atomic
    commit and rollback capabilities of SQLite. The <a href="lang_transaction.html">ROLLBACK</a> command
    no longer works; it behaves in an undefined way.  Applications must
    avoid using the <a href="lang_transaction.html">ROLLBACK</a> command when the journal mode is OFF.
    If the application crashes
    in the middle of a transaction when the OFF journaling mode is
    set, then the database file will very likely go corrupt.</p>

    <p>Note that the journal_mode for an <a href="inmemorydb.html">in-memory database</a>
    is either MEMORY or OFF and can not be changed to a different value.
    An attempt to change the journal_mode of an <a href="inmemorydb.html">in-memory database</a> to
    any setting other than MEMORY or OFF is ignored.  Note also that
    the journal_mode cannot be changed while a transaction is active.</p>

    PRAGMA journal_size_limit<br>

  <p>If a database connection is operating in
  <a href="pragma.html#pragma_locking_mode">exclusive locking mode</a> or in
  <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">persistent journal mode</a> 
  (PRAGMA journal_mode=persist) then
  after committing a transaction the <a href="lockingv3.html#rollback">rollback journal</a> file may remain in
  the file-system. This increases performance for subsequent transactions
  since overwriting an existing file is faster than append to a file,
  but it also consumes
  file-system space. After a large transaction (e.g. a <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>),
  the rollback journal file may consume a very large amount of space.

  <p>Similarly, in <a href="wal.html">WAL mode</a>, the write-ahead log file is not truncated
  following a <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a>.  Instead, SQLite reuses the existing file
  for subsequent WAL entries since overwriting is faster than appending.

  <p>The journal_size_limit pragma may be used to limit the size of 
  rollback-journal and WAL files left
  in the file-system after transactions or checkpoints.
  Each time a transaction is committed or a WAL file resets, SQLite 
  compares the size of the rollback journal file or WAL file left in 
  the file-system to the size limit
  set by this pragma and if the journal or WAL file is larger 
  it is truncated to the limit.

  <p>The second form of the pragma listed above is used to set a new limit
  in bytes for the specified database.  A negative number implies no limit.
  To always truncate rollback journals and WAL files to their minimum size, 
  set the journal_size_limit to zero.
  Both the first and second forms of the pragma listed above return a single
  result row containing a single integer column - the value of the journal
  size limit in bytes. The default journal size limit is -1 (no limit).  The
  <a href="compile.html#default_journal_size_limit">SQLITE_DEFAULT_JOURNAL_SIZE_LIMIT</a> preprocessor macro can be used to change
  the default journal size limit at compile-time.</p>

  <p>This pragma only operates on the single database specified prior
  to the pragma name (or on the "main" database if no database is specified.)
  There is no way to change the journal size limit on all attached databases
  using a single PRAGMA statement.  The size limit must be set separately for
  each attached database.

    write transaction. When the locking-mode is set to EXCLUSIVE, the
    database connection never releases file-locks. The first time the
    database is read in EXCLUSIVE mode, a shared lock is obtained and 
    held. The first time the database is written, an exclusive lock is
    obtained and held.</p>

    <p>Database locks obtained by a connection in EXCLUSIVE mode may be
    released either by closing the database connection, or by setting the
    locking-mode back to NORMAL using this pragma and then accessing the
    database file (for read or write). Simply setting the locking-mode to
    NORMAL is not enough - locks are not released until the next time
    the database file is accessed.</p>

    <p>There are three reasons to set the locking-mode to EXCLUSIVE.
    <ol>
    <li>The application wants to prevent other processes from
        accessing the database file.
    <li>The number of system calls for filesystem operations is reduced,
        possibly resulting in a small performance increase.
    <li><a href="wal.html">WAL</a> databases can be accessed in EXCLUSIVE mode without the
        use of shared memory. 
        (<a href="wal.html#noshm">Additional information</a>)
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>When the locking_mode pragma specifies a particular database,
    for example:</p>

    <blockquote>
PRAGMA <b>main.</b>locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE;
    </blockquote>

    <p>Then the locking mode applies only to the named database.  If no
    database name qualifier precedes the "locking_mode" keyword then
    the locking mode is applied to all databases, including any new
    databases added by subsequent <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> commands.</p>

   <p>The "temp" database (in which TEMP tables and indices are stored)
   and <a href="inmemorydb.html">in-memory databases</a>
   always uses exclusive locking mode.  The locking mode of temp and
   <a href="inmemorydb.html">in-memory databases</a> cannot
   be changed.  All other databases use the normal locking mode by default
   and are affected by this pragma.</p>

   <p>If the locking mode is EXCLUSIVE when first entering
   <a href="wal.html">WAL journal mode</a>, then the locking mode cannot be changed to
   NORMAL until after exiting WAL journal mode. 
   If the locking mode is NORMAL when first entering WAL
   journal mode, then the locking mode can be changed between NORMAL and
   EXCLUSIVE and back again at any time and without needing to exit
   WAL journal mode.</p>

       statements.</p>

    <p>The argument N is the maximum number of bytes of the database file
       that will be accessed using memory-mapped I/O.  If N is zero then
       memory mapped I/O is disabled.  If N is negative, then the limit
       reverts to the default value determined by the most recent
       <a href="c3ref/config.html">sqlite3_config</a>(<a href="c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmmapsize">SQLITE_CONFIG_MMAP_SIZE</a>), or to the compile

       start-time limit has been set.</p>

    <p>The <a href="pragma.html#pragma_mmap_size">PRAGMA mmap_size</a> statement will never increase the amount
       of address space used for memory-mapped I/O above the
       hard limit set by the <a href="compile.html#max_mmap_size">SQLITE_MAX_MMAP_SIZE</a> compile-time option,

    <p>The size of the memory-mapped I/O region cannot be changed while
       the memory-mapped I/O region is in active use, to avoid unmapping
       memory out from under running SQL statements.  For this reason,
       the mmap_size pragma may be a no-op if the prior mmap_size is non-zero
       and there are other SQL statements running concurrently on the same

    size must be a power of two between 512 and 65536 inclusive.
    </p>

    <p>When a new database is created, SQLite assigned a default page size
    based on information received from the xSectorSize and 
    xDeviceCharacteristics methods of the <a href="c3ref/io_methods.html">sqlite3_io_methods</a> object
    of the newly created database file.  The page_size pragma will only
    cause an immediate change in the
    page size if it is issued while the database is still empty, prior 
    to the first CREATE TABLE statement.  If the page_size pragma is
    used to specify a new page size just prior to
    running the <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command and if the database is not in
    <a href="wal.html">WAL journal mode</a> then <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> will change the page
    size to the new value.</p>

    <p>If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_ATOMIC_WRITE option,
    then the default page size is chosen to be the largest page size
    less than or equal to SQLITE_MAX_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE for which atomic
    write is enabled according to the
    xDeviceCharacteristics method of the <a href="c3ref/io_methods.html">sqlite3_io_methods</a> object for
    the database file.  If the SQLITE_ENABLE_ATOMIC_WRITE option is
    disabled or if xDeviceCharacteristics reports no suitable atomic
    write page sizes, then the default page size is the larger of 
    SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE
    and the sector size as reported by the xSectorSize method of the
    <a href="c3ref/io_methods.html">sqlite3_io_methods</a> object, but not more than 
    SQLITE_MAX_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE.  The normal configuration for SQLite
    running on workstations is for atomic write to be
    disabled, for the maximum page size to be set to 65536, for
    SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE to be 1024, and for the
    maximum default page size to be set to 8192.  The default xSectorSize
    method on unix workstation implementations always reports a sector size
    of 512 bytes.  Hence, 
    the default page size chosen by SQLite on unix is usually 1024 bytes.
    On windows, the GetDiskFreeSpace() interface is used to obtain the
    actual device sector size and hence the default page size on windows
    will sometimes be greater than 1024.</p>

    sometimes new versions of SQLite will contain optimizer enhancements
    that will cause the output order of queries without ORDER BY clauses

<p>    The pragmas schema_version and user_version are used to set or get
       the value of the schema-version and user-version, respectively. The

       respectively.</p>
  
<p>    The schema-version is usually only manipulated internally by SQLite.  
       It is incremented by SQLite whenever the database schema is modified 
       (by creating or dropping a table or index). The schema version is 
       used by SQLite each time a query is executed to ensure that the 
       internal cache of the schema used when compiling the SQL query matches 
       the schema of the database against which the compiled query is actually 
       executed.  Subverting this mechanism by using "PRAGMA schema_version" 
       to modify the schema-version is potentially dangerous and may lead 
       to program crashes or database corruption. Use with caution!</p>

    <p>Query or change the setting of the "synchronous" flag.
    The first (query) form will return the synchronous setting as an 
    integer.  When synchronous is FULL (2), the SQLite database engine will
    use the xSync method of the <a href="vfs.html">VFS</a> to ensure that all content is safely
    written to the disk surface prior to continuing.
    This ensures that an operating system crash or power failure will
    not corrupt the database.
    FULL synchronous is very safe, but it is also slower. 
    When synchronous is NORMAL (1), the SQLite database
    engine will still sync at the most critical moments, but less often
    than in FULL mode.  There is a very small (though non-zero) chance that
    a power failure at just the wrong time could corrupt the database in
    NORMAL mode.  But in practice, you are more likely to suffer
    a catastrophic disk failure or some other unrecoverable hardware
    fault.
    With synchronous OFF (0), SQLite continues without syncing
    as soon as it has handed data off to the operating system.
    If the application running SQLite crashes, the data will be safe, but
    the database might become corrupted if the operating system
    crashes or the computer loses power before that data has been written
    to the disk surface.  On the other hand, some
    operations are as much as 50 or more times faster with synchronous OFF.
    </p>
 
    <p>In <a href="wal.html">WAL</a> mode when synchronous is NORMAL (1), the WAL file is
    synchronized before each <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> and the database file is
    synchronized after each completed <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> and the WAL file
    header is synchronized when a WAL file begins to be reused after
    a checkpoint, but no sync operations occur during most transactions.
    With synchronous=FULL in WAL mode, an additional
    sync operation of the WAL file happens after each transaction commit.
    The extra WAL sync following each transaction help ensure that 
    transactions are durable across a power loss, but they do not aid
    in preserving consistency.
    If durability is not a concern, then synchronous=NORMAL is normally
    all one needs in WAL mode.</p>

    <p>The default setting is synchronous=FULL.</p>

    <p>Changing the temp_store_directory setting is <u>not</u> threadsafe.
    Never change the temp_store_directory setting if another thread
    within the application is running any SQLite interface at the same time.
    Doing so results in undefined behavior.  Changing the temp_store_directory
    setting writes to the <a href="c3ref/temp_directory.html">sqlite3_temp_directory</a> global
    variable and that global variable is not protected by a mutex.</p>

    <p>The value <i>directory-name</i> should be enclosed in single quotes.
    To revert the directory to the default, set the <i>directory-name</i> to
    an empty string, e.g., <i>PRAGMA temp_store_directory = ''</i>.  An
    error is raised if <i>directory-name</i> is not found or is not
    writable. </p>

    <p>The default directory for temporary files depends on the OS.  Some
    OS interfaces may choose to ignore this variable and place temporary
    files in some other directory different from the directory specified
    here.  In that sense, this pragma is only advisory.</p>

    <a href="wal.html#ckpt">auto-checkpoint</a> interval.
    When the <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> is enabled (via the

    the write-ahead log equals or exceeds <i>N</i> pages in length.
    Setting the auto-checkpoint size to zero or a negative value
    turns auto-checkpointing off.</p>
    
    <p>This pragma is a wrapper around the
    <a href="c3ref/wal_autocheckpoint.html">sqlite3_wal_autocheckpoint()</a> C interface.
    All automatic checkpoints are <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html">PASSIVE</a>.</p>

    <p>Autocheckpointing is enabled by default with an interval

    <p>If the <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> is enabled (via the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">journal_mode pragma</a>),
    this pragma causes a <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> operation to run on database
    <i>database</i>, or on all attached databases if <i>database</i>
    is omitted.  If <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> mode is disabled, this pragma is a
    harmless no-op.</p>

    <p>Invoking this
    pragma without an argument is equivalent to calling the
    <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint()</a> C interface.</p>
    Invoking this pragma with an argument is equivalent to calling the
    <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()</a> C interface with a 
    <a href="c3ref/c_checkpoint_full.html">3rd parameter</a>
    corresponding to the argument:

    <dl>
    <dt>PASSIVE<dd>
      Checkpoint as many frames as possible without waiting for any database 
      readers or writers to finish. Sync the db file if all frames in the log
      are checkpointed. This mode is the same as calling 
      sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(). The
      <a href="c3ref/busy_handler.html">busy-handler callback</a> is never invoked.
   
    <dt>FULL<dd>
      This mode blocks 
      (invokes the <a href="c3ref/busy_handler.html">busy-handler callback</a>)
      until there is no
      database writer and all readers are reading from the most recent database
      snapshot. It then checkpoints all frames in the log file and syncs the
      database file. FULL blocks database writers while it is
      running, but not database readers.
   
    <dt>RESTART<dd>
      This mode works the same way as SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL, except after 
      checkpointing the log file it blocks (calls the 
      <a href="c3ref/busy_handler.html">busy-handler callback</a>)
      until all readers are reading from the database file only. This ensures 
      that the next client to write to the database file restarts the log file 
      from the beginning. RESTART blocks database writers while it is
      running, but not database readers.
    </dl>


    <p>The wal_checkpoint pragma returns a single row with three
    integer columns.  The first column is usually 0 but will be
    1 if a RESTART or FULL checkpoint was blocked from completing,
    for example because another thread or process was actively
    using the database.  In other words, the first column is 0 if the
    equivalent call to <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint_v2.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2()</a> would have returned
    <a href="rescode.html#ok">SQLITE_OK</a> or 1 if the equivalent call would have returned <a href="rescode.html#busy">SQLITE_BUSY</a>.
    The second column is the number of modified pages that have been
    written to the write-ahead log file.
    The third column is the number of pages in the write-ahead log file
    that have been successfully moved back into the database file at
    the conclusion of the checkpoint.
   The second and third column are -1 if there is no
    write-ahead log, for example if this pragma is invoked on a database
    connection that is not in <a href="wal.html">WAL mode</a>.</p>

    statements.  Warning:  misuse of this pragma can easily result in
