      <h1 class="dtH1">About SQLite.NET</h1>
      <p>This class library is an ADO.NET 2.0 wrapper around the popular (and free!) 
        SQLite database engine. For information on SQL syntax, features of SQLite and a 
        good understanding of how it works and what it does, I highly recommend heading 
        over to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sqlite.org">sqlite.org</a> and 
        reading the documentation there.</p>
      <P>The C# provider, the very minor C code modifications to SQLite, documentation and 
        etc&nbsp;were written by <A href="mailto:robert@blackcastlesoft.com">Robert 
          Simpson</A>, and the SourceForge project page can be found <A target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlite-dotnet2">
          here</A>.</P>

      <h1 class="dtH1">SQLite.NET Provider Features</h1>
      <p>This SQLite provider implements every feature of the underlying SQLite 
        database engine without omission. Here's a brief summary:</p><div>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        Written from scratch on VS2005 specifically for ADO.NET 2.0, implenting all the
        base classes and features recently introduced in the framework, including automatic
        transaction enlistment.<li>Supports the Full and Compact .NET Framework, as well as
          native C/C++ development.&nbsp; 100% binary compatible with the original sqlite3.dll.
        </li>
        <li>
        On the Compact Framework, it is faster than the newly-introduced Sql Server Mobile.
          SQLite's installed size is a fraction of Sql Mobile's. It uses less memory at runtime,
          runs queries faster, and has a smaller database file size as well. </li>
        <li>Encrypted database support.&nbsp; Encrypted databases are fully encrypted and
          support both binary and cleartext password types. </li>
        <li>Visual Studio 2005 Design-Time Support.&nbsp; You can add a SQLite 
        database to the Servers list, design queries with the Query Designer, 
        drag-and-drop tables onto a Typed DataSet, etc. </li>
        <li>
        Single file redistributable.&nbsp; The core sqlite3 codebase and the ADO.NET wrapper 
        are combined into one multi-module assembly. </li>
        <li>Binaries included for Itanium, x64, x86 and ARM processors. </li>
        <li>
        DbProviderFactory support. </li>
        <li>
          Full support for ATTACH'ed databases.&nbsp; Exposed as <i>Catalogs</i>
        in the schema.&nbsp; When cloning a connection, all attached databases are 
        automatically re-attached to the new connection. </li>
        <li>
          DbConnection.GetSchema(...) support includes the <i>MetaDataCollections</i>, <i>
          DataSourceInformation</i>, <i>Columns</i>, <i>Tables</i>, <i>Views, ViewColumns, </i>
          <i>Catalogs, </i><i>Indexes, 
            IndexColumns </i>and <em>ForeignKeys</em>
        keywords.
        </li>
        <li>
        Enhanced DbDataReader.GetSchemaTable() functionality returns catalog, namespace 
        and detailed schema information even for complex queries. </li>
        <li>
        Named and unnamed parameters. </li>
        <li>
        Full UTF-8 and UTF-16 support, each with optimized pipelines into the native 
        database core. </li>
        <li>
        Multiple simultaneous DataReaders (one DataReader per Command however). </li>
        <li>
        Full support for user-defined scalar and aggregate functions, encapsulated into 
        an easy-to-use base class in which only a couple of overrides are necessary to 
        implement new SQL functions. </li>
        <li>
        Full support for user-defined collating sequences, every bit as simple to 
        implement as user-defined functions and uses the same base class. </li>
        <li>
          Full source for the entire engine and wrapper.&nbsp; No copyrights.&nbsp; 
          Public Domain.&nbsp; 100% free for commercial and non-commercial use.&nbsp;</li>
      </UL>
        </div>

      <h1 class="dtH1">Distributing the Binaries</h1>
      <p><b>System.Data.SQLite.DLL</b> is a mixed assembly signed with a strong name 
        in case you want to add it to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). This is the only DLL required to be redistributed with 
        your SQLite.NET application(s).&nbsp; It 
        comes in&nbsp;4
        flavors: Win32, Itanium, X64 (AMD64) and ARM (Compact Framework).&nbsp; The Compact
        Framework library is signed with a separate strong name, but all the other
        versions share the same strong name so they can be interchanged where appropriate without
        any change to your application.</p>
