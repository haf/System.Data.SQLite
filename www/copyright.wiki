In order to keep System.Data.SQLite completely free and unencumbered by

to dedicate their contributions to the public domain.
If you want to send a patch or enhancement for possible inclusion in the
System.Data.SQLite source tree, please accompany the patch with the following
statement:
</p>

<blockquote><i>

in this code to the public domain.  We make this dedication for the benefit
of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and successors.
