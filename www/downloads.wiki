        All the &quot;bundle&quot; packages contain the

        should <b>only</b> be used in cases where the assembly binary

        Assembly Cache</a> for some reason (e.g. to support some legacy
        application on customer machines).
        <br /><br />
        All the &quot;static&quot; packages contain either native or mixed-mode
        assembly binaries linked statically to the appropriate version of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C++">Visual C++</a>
        runtime.  Typically, these packages are used in cases where customer
        machines may not have the necessary version of the Visual C++ runtime
        installed and it cannot be installed due to limited privileges.
        <br /><br />
        The next step is to identify the version of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a>
        being targeted by the application.
        Generally, assembly binaries linked against the

        2.0</a> (or the
        <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=124150">.NET Framework

        <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=186913">.NET Framework
        4.0</a> (or higher); however, this is less than ideal.  Furthermore,
        assemblies linked against the .NET Framework 4.0 (or higher)
        <b>cannot</b> be loaded by any versions of the .NET Framework prior to
        4.0.

        The final step is to identify the target processor architecture on both
        the development and customer machines.  Generally,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a> binaries will work on
        an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64">x64</a> machine running
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> (using
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64">WoW64</a>).  However, there
        is a problem when using managed code.  If the executable that starts the
        process consists entirely of managed code, it will run with the native
        processor architecture of the machine, which will be x64 on an x64
        machine.  Later on, this will cause assemblies containing any native
        code compiled for x86 (e.g. the &quot;System.Data.SQLite.dll&quot;
        mixed-mode assembly, the &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot; native interop
        assembly, or the &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot; native library) to fail to
        load, typically resulting in a
        <a href="faq.wiki#q12">BadImageFormatException</a> being thrown.
        <br /><br />
        If the development and customer machines may have different processor
        architectures, more than one binary package may be required.  For this
        situation, using the <b>native library pre-loading feature</b> is highly
        recommended.  It is available as of version 1.0.80.0 and enabled by
        default.  In order to take advantage of this feature, the separate
        managed and interop assemblies <b>must</b> be used with XCOPY deployment
        (i.e. this feature is not supported by the mixed-mode assembly, nor when
        the assembly is deployed to the global assembly cache), resulting in an
        application deployment that looks something like this:

        <br /><br />
        Use of environment variables for configuration settings is not
