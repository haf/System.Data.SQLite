<p>
  <b>(1) When will the next version of System.Data.SQLite be released?</b>
</p>

<p>
  The release schedule for the System.Data.SQLite project is roughly
  synchronized (within about two or three weeks) with that of the
  [http://www.sqlite.org/ | SQLite] core itself.  The release history for the
  System.Data.SQLite project is [./news.wiki | here].

<p>
  <b>(2) When are you planning on adding feature &quot;X&quot;?</b>
</p>

<p>
  This question is hard to answer precisely.  It depends on a number of factors,
  including but not limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Can the feature be implemented in a backward compatible manner?
    </li>

    <li>
      Can the feature be implemented in a portable fashion for all the currently
      supported versions of the .NET Framework and/or Visual Studio?
    </li>

    <li>
      Does the feature fit well with the current design of the project?
    </li>

    <li>
      How much time will it take to design, implement, and test the feature?
    </li>

    <li>
      Will the feature benefit the entire community or only a tiny subset
      thereof?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<a name="q3"></a>
<p>
  <b>(3) What versions of .NET Framework are supported?</b>
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 (or higher) for the System.Data.SQLite assembly.
    </li>

    <li>
      The .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (or higher) for the System.Data.SQLite.Linq
      assembly.
    </li>

    <li>
      The .NET Framework 4.0 (or higher) for the System.Data.SQLite.EF6
      assembly.

<p>
  <b>(4) What versions of Visual Studio are supported?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Currently, Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013 are supported,
  including the &quot;Express&quot; editions; however, in order to build the
  entire solution, including the necessary native code, the &quot;Professional&quot;
  edition (or higher) is required.  It may be possible to install both Visual C#
  Express and Visual C++ Express and then build the corresponding sub-projects
  via their respective integrated development environments (IDE); however, this
  configuration has <b>not</b> been tested.  The design-time components are
  <b>no longer</b> supported for the Express editions due to licensing
  restrictions.

  <b>(8) How do I install System.Data.SQLite on a development machine?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Strictly speaking, there is no need to install System.Data.SQLite on any
  development machine (e.g. via the setup).  The recommended way to use the
  assemblies is:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Download the precompiled binary package for your target framework and
      processor architecture (e.g. 32-bit x86, .NET Framework 2.0).
    </li>

    <li>
      Extract the package to a directory named "Externals" inside your project
      directory.
    </li>

    <li>
      Add a reference to the "System.Data.SQLite" assembly from the "Externals"
      directory.
    </li>

    <li>
      If necessary (i.e. you require LINQ support), also add a reference to the
      "System.Data.SQLite.Linq" assembly from the "Externals" directory.
    </li>

    <li>
      If necessary (i.e. you require EF6 support), also add a reference to the
      "System.Data.SQLite.EF6" assembly from the "Externals" directory.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, when using Visual Studio 2010 or later, you can simply use the
  NuGet package that corresponds to your target processor architecture.
  Installing the assemblies into the Global Assembly Cache is not recommended as
  it may cause conflicts with other applications installed on the machine.

<p>
  <b>(9) How do I install System.Data.SQLite on end-user machines?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Strictly speaking, there is no need to install System.Data.SQLite on any
  end-user machine (e.g. via the setup).  The recommended way to deploy the
  assemblies is &quot;application local&quot; (i.e. copy them to the directory
  the application is installed to).  Installing the assemblies into the Global
  Assembly Cache is not recommended as it may cause conflicts with other
  applications installed on the machine.

  <b>(10) Do I need to add an assembly reference to the
  &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot; or &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot; in my project?</b>
</p>

<p>
  No, because they are not managed assemblies and contain no managed code.

<p>
  <b>(11) Why do I get a DllNotFoundException (for &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot;
  or &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot;) when trying to run my application?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Either the named dynamic link library (DLL) cannot be located or it cannot be
  loaded due to missing dependencies.  Make sure the named dynamic link library
  is located in the application directory or a directory along the system PATH
  and try again.  Also, be sure the necessary Visual C++ runtime redistributable
  has been installed unless you are using a dynamic link library that was built
  statically linked to it.

<p>
  <b>(12) Why do I get a BadImageFormatException (for &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot; or
  &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot;) when trying to run my application?</b>
</p>

<p>
  The named dynamic link library (DLL) contains native code that was built for a
  processor architecture that is not compatible with the current process (e.g.
  you cannot load a 32-bit dynamic link library into a 64-bit process or
  vice-versa).  Another explanation is that the named dynamic link library was
  built for a later version of the CLR than is available in the current process
  (e.g. you cannot load an assembly built for the .NET Framework 4.0 into a .NET
  Framework 2.0 process, regardless of the processor architecture).

<p>
  <b>(13) Why do I get the error &quot;This assembly is built by a runtime newer
  than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded.&quot;?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Because the assembly was built for the .NET Framework 4.0 and you are trying
  to load it into a process that is using the .NET Framework 2.0.

<a name="q14"></a>
<p>
  <b>(14) What is a mixed-mode assembly?</b>
</p>

<p>
  A mixed-mode assembly is a dynamic link library that contains both managed
  code and native code for a particular processor architecture.  Since it
  contains native code it can only be loaded into a process that matches the
  processor architecture it was compiled for.  Also see this

<p>
  <b>(15) What is a &quot;bundle&quot; package (i.e. from the download page)?</b>
</p>

<p>
  The &quot;bundle&quot; packages listed on the download page contains the
  System.Data.SQLite mixed-mode assembly in a file named
  &quot;System.Data.SQLite.dll&quot; (see <a href="#q14">question #14</a>)
  instead of separate &quot;System.Data.SQLite.dll&quot; and
  &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot; files to contain the managed code and native
  code, respectively.

<p>
  <b>(16) What is the difference between the &quot;Setup&quot; and
  &quot;Precompiled Binary&quot; packages (i.e. from the download page)?</b>
</p>

<p>
  The &quot;Setup&quot; packages are designed to install the necessary files,
  optionally installing the assemblies into the Global Assembly Cache,
  generating native images for the managed assemblies via Ngen, adding Start
  Menu shortcuts, modifying the .NET Framework machine configuration files to
  register the ADO.NET provider, and installing the design-time components for
  Visual Studio.  The &quot;Precompiled Binary&quot; packages are simply ZIP
  files that contain all the binaries compiled for a particular .NET Framework
  and processor architecture.

<p>
  <b>(17) Why is System.Data.SQLite leaking memory, resources, etc?</b>
</p>

<p>
  All System.Data.SQLite objects that implement IDisposable, either directly or
  indirectly, should be explicitly disposed when they are no longer needed.  If
  this is the case and you are still seeing a leak of some kind, please file a
  <a href="/index.html/tktnew">ticket</a>.

<p>
  <b>(19) When the solution is loaded in Visual Studio, why do no files show up
  for several of the projects in the Solution Explorer window?</b>
</p>

<p>
  Several of the sub-projects (i.e. primarily those that build variants of the
  System.Data.SQLite assembly) share an MSBuild &quot;targets&quot; file that
  contains the actual references to the C# source code files.  Unfortunately,
  due to limitations on how Visual Studio reads and interprets MSBuild files at
  design-time, the C# source code files do not show up in the Solution Explorer
  window.  This limitation is largely cosmetic and does <b>not</b> impact the
  correctness of the build process itself, whether in Visual Studio or when
  using MSBuild on the command line.

  <b>(20) When the System.Data.SQLite project is compiled and run from inside
  Visual Studio, why do I get a DllNotFoundException or a BadImageFormatException
  (for &quot;sqlite3.dll&quot; or &quot;SQLite.Interop.dll&quot;) when trying to
  run or debug the application?</b>
</p>

<p>
  When compiling and running a solution from within Visual Studio that uses the
  System.Data.SQLite project (including the test project), it is very important
  to select the correct build configuration and platform.  First, managed
  applications to be debugged inside Visual Studio cannot use the mixed-mode
  assembly (i.e. because it is always compiled to the platform-specific build
  output directory).  This is necessary to properly support building binaries
  for multiple platforms using the same source project files.  Therefore, only
  the &quot;DebugNativeOnly&quot; or &quot;ReleaseNativeOnly&quot; build
  configurations should be selected when running a managed application from
  inside Visual Studio that relies upon the System.Data.SQLite assembly.  These
  build configurations contain a custom post-build step that copies the required
  native assembly to the managed output directory (i.e. to enable running the
  managed binaries in-place).  However, this post-build step will only be
  performed if the selected platform matches that of the operating system (e.g.
  &quot;Win32&quot; for 32-bit Windows and &quot;x64&quot; for 64-bit Windows).
  Therefore, it is good practice to double-check the selected build platform
  against the operating system prior to attempting to run a managed project in
  the solution.

  <b>(21) Is this behavior a bug? -OR- Is there a quick way to view the various
  lists of tickets for the System.Data.SQLite project?</b>
</p>

<p>
  If any behavior is observed that appears to be a bug, it may be reported via
  the <a href="/index.html/doc/trunk/www/support.wiki">sqlite-users</a> public
  mailing list or by filing a <a href="/index.html/tktnew">ticket</a>.  Prior
  to taking one of these steps, it is always prudent to check the various lists
  of previously filed tickets to see if the behavior being observed has already
  been reported and possibly fixed in a subsequent release.

  <b>(22) Since upgrading a project to use System.Data.SQLite version 1.0.82.0
  (or later), the database file is still locked after all its connections have
  been closed.  Why is this happening?
</b>
</p>

<p>
  As of version 1.0.82.0, the native resources for a SQLiteConnection object,
  including any native locks on the underlying file, are not fully released
  until all SQLiteCommand, SQLiteDataReader, SQLiteStatement, and SQLiteBackup
  objects associated with that SQLiteConnection object have also been disposed.
  These changes were made to allow the SQLite native resource management to
  integrate better with the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">garbage collection</a>
  semantics used by the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">Common Language
  Runtime</a>.  Allowing native SQLite resources to be released in a
  non-deterministic order is accomplished through careful use of the
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/close.html">sqlite3_close_v2()</a> core
  native library routine.
</p>
