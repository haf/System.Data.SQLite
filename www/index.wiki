  This is a fork of the popular ADO.NET adapter for
  [http://www.sqlite.org/ | SQLite] known as System.Data.SQLite.  The originator
  of System.Data.SQLite, Robert Simpson, is aware of this fork, has expressed
  his approval, and has commit privileges on the new Fossil repository.  The
  SQLite Development Team intends to maintain the System.Data.SQLite project
  moving forward.
