<title>Source Code</title>

<p>
  Follow these steps to obtain the latest (i.e. unreleased) source code for the
  System.Data.SQLite project.
  To obtain the latest officially released source code instead, please refer to
  the [./downloads.wiki | downloads page].
  Unless otherwise noted, all steps need to be done in the order specified.

<h2>Assumptions &amp; Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  The string &quot;&lt;root&gt;&quot; represents the directory where you would
  like the local copy of source tree (i.e. the working check-out directory) for
  the System.Data.SQLite project to reside (this should be a completely empty
  directory).
</p>

<a name="fossil"></a>
<h2>Obtain &amp; Install Fossil</h2>

<p>
  [http://www.fossil-scm.org | Fossil] is a computer program that must be
  installed on your machine before you use it.  Fortunately, installing Fossil
  is very easy.  Fossil consists of a single executable file that you simply
  download and run.  For convenience, the Fossil executable file should be
  placed in a directory present in your
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29 | PATH].  To uninstall
  Fossil, simply delete the executable file.
  [http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/tip/www/quickstart.wiki | Detailed instructions]
  for installing and getting started with Fossil are available on the
  [http://www.fossil-scm.org/ | Fossil website].

<a name="clone"></a>
<h2>Clone Repository (Windows)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open a normal command prompt window with &quot;cmd.exe&quot;.</li>

  <li>Change the current directory to &quot;&lt;root&gt;&quot;.</li>

  <li>
    Enter the following command to create a complete clone (i.e. local copy) of
    the entire source code repository for the System.Data.SQLite project,
    including the entire check-in history:&nbsp;
    <b>fossil&nbsp;clone&nbsp;http://system.data.sqlite.org/&nbsp;sds.fossil</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    The repository itself uses an
    [http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/fileformat.wiki | enduring file format]
    stored in a single
    [http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/tech_overview.wiki | SQLite database file]
    with a particular schema.
  </li>

  <li>
    In this case, after executing the
    <b>[http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/help/clone | clone]</b> command,
    the local clone of the repository will be placed into the
    &quot;<b>sds.fossil</b>&quot; file in the current directory.
  </li>
</ol>

<a name="working"></a>
<h2>Working Copy (Windows)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Open a normal command prompt window with &quot;cmd.exe&quot;.</li>

  <li>Change the current directory to &quot;&lt;root&gt;&quot;.</li>

  <li>
    Enter the following command to create a complete
    working copy of all the files that are currently part of the
    System.Data.SQLite project:&nbsp;<b>fossil&nbsp;open&nbsp;sds.fossil</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    The local source tree should now be ready for use as described in the
    [./build.wiki | build procedures] and/or [./test.wiki | test procedures].
  </li>

  <li>
    In the future, to update the working copy with the latest changes from the
    official System.Data.SQLite repository (i.e. instead of having to re-clone
    the entire thing), enter the following command from the same directory where
    a working copy is located:&nbsp;<b>fossil&nbsp;update</b>
  </li>
</ol>
