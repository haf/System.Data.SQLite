Optimize SQL.
Write some documentation eg: how to configure the provider via web.config
Dump SQL statements to some sort of human readable format & possibly document them.

? Create a default DB location & make the schema a resource so one can just plunk the provider in and have it just work with little or no config.
? Implement Profile Provider
? Implement a fully dynamic SiteMap Provider so changes to the DB get reflected immediatly
